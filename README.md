**hello my name is li fangying.**<p>
this is my first time to use linux symtem and i know nothing about git.<p>
it takes me some time to find out what git is,it's really an interesting thing. Besides, if professor can introduce more related messages about computional terms, like this, i will be grateful.<p>
And i find i sometimes cannot use commands correctly,for example, i feel confuse about when i should insert space, that makes me a little anxious. but,in all is a joyful process(^ ^)
