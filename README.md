**hello my name is li fangying.**
this is my first time to use linux symtem and i know nothing about git.<p>
it takes me some time to find out what git is,it is really an interesting thing.If professor can introduce more related message about computional terms,like this,i will be grateful.<p>
And i find i often cannot use some commands correctly,that makes me a little anxious.  <p> 
but,in all is a joyful process(^ ^)
